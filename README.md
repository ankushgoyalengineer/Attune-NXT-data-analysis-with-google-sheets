# Attune-NXT-data-analysis-with-google-sheets

Currently, our lab is analyzing stained iPSCs for Sendai expression. 
iPSCs stained with CD56+, TRA160+ and HN antibody were analyzed on Attune NXT. Looking at the data, we can infer that cells low sendai expression can eventually be sendai free in next few passages.

After user completes the analysis, they export the data in a designated folder in .csv format. Script will take the data, process it and generates a report on google sheets. This generated report then helps in identifying the samples with high sendai expression and the factors responsible for them.
